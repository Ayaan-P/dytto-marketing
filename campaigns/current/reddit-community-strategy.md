3. **Engagement Hooks**: Questions and discussion starters prepared
4. **Value-First**: Lead with what community gets, not what we want

### **POST-LAUNCH ENGAGEMENT**

#### **First Hour** (Critical for algorithm visibility)
- Monitor comments every 10 minutes
- Respond to every comment with value-added responses
- Upvote thoughtful questions and engagement
- Cross-post to relevant secondary subreddits if allowed

#### **24-Hour Window**
- **Morning Check** (9 AM): Respond to overnight comments
- **Midday Check** (1 PM): Engage with peak-hour discussions
- **Evening Check** (6 PM): Respond to after-work comments
- **Night Check** (10 PM): Final responses before next day

#### **Response Strategy**
- **Technical Questions**: Provide working code examples or detailed explanations
- **Skepticism**: Acknowledge concerns and provide evidence/data
- **Feature Requests**: Thank user and explain if/how it could be implemented
- **Praise**: Thank genuinely and ask for specific feedback

### **COMMENT ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK**

#### **The Value-First Response Pattern**
```

2. **Answer**: Provide specific, actionable information
3. **Expand**: Share related insight or example
4. **Engage**: Ask follow-up question to continue conversation
5. **Resource**: Link to relevant documentation or examples (if helpful)
```

#### **Example Responses**:

**For Technical Questions**:
```
"Great question about context retention! Here's exactly how we handle that:

[Code example or technical explanation]

The key insight we discovered is that semantic similarity isn't enough - you need temporal relevance weighting. I wrote a detailed post about our approach here: [link]

Have you experimented with different context weighting strategies in your projects? I'd love to hear what's worked for you."
```

**For Skeptical Comments**:
```
"I totally understand that skepticism - I felt the same way about AI 'memory' claims until we built this.

Here's the specific data that convinced me we were onto something:
- 94% context relevance accuracy (user-rated)
- 30-day context retention without degradation
- Real user feedback: [specific example]

The difference is we're not just storing chat history - we're building semantic understanding of user patterns. Here's a technical breakdown: [link]

What would you need to see to be convinced this is different from existing approaches?"
```

**For Feature Requests**:
```
"That's actually a brilliant idea! The ability to [specific feature] would be incredibly valuable for [specific use case].

We've been thinking about this exact problem. The technical challenge is [specific challenge], but I think it's definitely solvable with [potential approach].

I'm adding this to our feature request tracker. Would you be interested in beta testing this feature when we build it? Also, are there any specific workflows where this would be most valuable for you?"

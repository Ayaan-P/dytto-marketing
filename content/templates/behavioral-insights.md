# BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS CONTENT TEMPLATE
## *Monday Content: Psychology of Human-AI Interaction*

---

## TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

### 1. **HOOK: THE COUNTERINTUITIVE INSIGHT**
*Start with something that challenges conventional wisdom*

**Examples**:
- "Perfect memory would ruin your life"
- "Why forgetting is essential for happiness"  
- "The reason AI feels so stupid isn't technical"
- "Your brain lies to you about your own memories"

### 2. **THE RESEARCH FOUNDATION**
*Cite credible psychological or behavioral research*

**Template**:
```
Recent research from [Institution] found that [surprising finding]. 

In the study, researchers [methodology] and discovered that [key insight].

This challenges the common assumption that [conventional wisdom].
```

**Research Sources**:
- Kahneman & Tversky (behavioral economics)
- Psychological Science journal
- Nature Human Behaviour  
- Memory & Cognition studies
- Social psychology research

### 3. **THE AI CONNECTION**
*Bridge from human psychology to AI limitations*

**Template**:
```
This has profound implications for how we build AI systems.

Current AI approaches assume [flawed assumption], but human psychology tells us [reality].

The result? AI that [current limitation] instead of [desired behavior].
```

### 4. **THE DYTTO SOLUTION**
*Show how context-aware AI addresses the psychological insight*

**Template**:
```
At Dytto, we've designed our context infrastructure around this psychological reality.

Instead of [conventional AI approach], we [Dytto approach].

This means our AI [resulting benefit] because it understands [human psychological factor].
```

### 5. **THE CALL TO THINKING**
*End with provocative questions that drive engagement*

**Examples**:
- "What would you want AI to forget about you?"
- "How does your mood change what information feels relevant?"
- "Which of your contexts would surprise even your closest friends?"

## SPECIFIC CONTENT IDEAS

### **WEEK 1: MEMORY AND NARRATIVE**

**Title**: "Why Perfect AI Memory Would Drive You Insane"

**Hook**: Imagine an AI that remembered every word you've ever said, every mistake you've made, every moment of weakness. Sounds helpful? It would actually be psychological torture.

**Research**: Studies on directed forgetting, memory reconsolidation, and the psychological importance of forgetting traumatic events.

**AI Connection**: Current AI systems have perfect recall but no understanding of what should be forgotten or how memories should evolve.

**Dytto Angle**: Our context processing understands the psychological importance of selective memory and narrative coherence.

**Question**: "What would you want AI to forget about you?"

### **WEEK 2: CONTEXT COLLAPSE**

**Title**: "How Social Media Broke Human Understanding (And What AI Can Learn)"

**Hook**: You act differently with your grandmother than with your college friends. But social media forces all your contexts into one feed, creating psychological chaos.

**Research**: danah boyd's research on context collapse, Goffman's presentation of self theory.

**AI Connection**: AI systems suffer from the same context collapse—they don't understand that you're a different person in different situations.

**Dytto Angle**: True AI understanding requires maintaining context boundaries, not collapsing them.

**Question**: "How many different versions of yourself exist in different contexts?"

### **WEEK 3: EMOTIONAL CONTAGION**

**Title**: "Why AI Needs to Catch Your Mood (Not Just Your Words)"

**Hook**: Your best friend can tell you're stressed before you say a word. But AI can't tell the difference between "I'm fine" when you're actually fine and "I'm fine" when you're falling apart.

**Research**: Emotional contagion studies, micro-expression research, contextual mood inference.

**AI Connection**: Current AI processes linguistic content but misses emotional context and subtext.

**Dytto Angle**: Context-aware AI that understands not just what you say, but how you're feeling when you say it.

**Question**: "How does your mood change what information feels relevant to you?"

### **WEEK 4: COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY**

**Title**: "The Paradox of Choice Is Killing Your AI Experience"

**Hook**: More options should be better, right? Wrong. Research shows that too many choices create anxiety, decision paralysis, and regret.

**Research**: Barry Schwartz's paradox of choice, cognitive load theory, decision fatigue studies.

**AI Connection**: AI systems often overwhelm users with possibilities instead of understanding what they actually need in context.

**Dytto Angle**: Context-aware AI that provides fewer, better options based on your current situation and psychological state.

**Question**: "When has having more choices made your life worse, not better?"
